**The Gates of Morning: Chapter 1 — The Canoe Builder**

Standing atop a coral ledge, Dick cast his gaze toward the southern horizon. Behind him, the relentless roar of the outer sea reverberated, flinging salty spindrift into the air. In front lay the calm expanse of Karolin's tranquil blue lagoon, its beauty accentuated by the swooping flights of fishing gulls.

This serene body of water, encircled by a vast 40-mile coral ring, was its own world—a tempestuous sea in stormy weather and an azure sanctuary in calmer times. And now, it all belonged to him. Dick, who had arrived just the day before.

The beach buzzed with life under the blazing sun. Women, children, and youths were engaged in their daily tasks: fishing with nets, playing games, and working on the paraka patches. They were his people now. The canoes resting on the sand, the deserted houses once housing war canoes—all were part of his domain.

As Dick turned his gaze from the lagoon toward the canoe houses, a shadow of thought crossed his face. He turned away from the gentle waters and faced the northern sea, where thunderous breakers crashed onto the outer beach. Beyond the horizon lay Palm Tree—a dreamy, yet devilish island, shrouded in mystery.

Sitting nearby on the coral was young Tari, the son of Le Taioi, the net maker. For Tari, life was a series of simple, known truths. Yet with all the Karolin men swept away by war, he realized they were left defenseless and without leadership, surrounded only by women, boys, and other children like himself.

Yesterday, a strange boat from the northern seas brought a new figure—a man who arrived with Katafa, a girl swept away years ago during a storm. The women whispered that this mysterious newcomer was their destined chief, sent by the gods. But Tari was unmoved by divine mysteries. Alone with this intriguing stranger and free from his mother's earshot, he asked directly, with all a child's candor.

"Taori," little Tari ventured, "who are you?"

If Dick dared to answer, could Tari comprehend the extraordinary tale he might unfold? "Tari," Dick might say, "I'm from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange. As a child smaller than you, I was stranded with an old sailor, Kearney, on that distant island you call Marua—Palm Tree—lying unseen fifty miles to the north. Kearney taught me the ways of fishing and crafting toy ships unlike your canoes.

And then one day, Katafa arrived—the girl whisked away in a storm. Together we waited after Kearney’s passing, isolated but free. She revealed the language of Karolin to me, naming me Taori. Bonded by love, we might have lingered forever on Marua—until a ship surfaced on the horizon, swarming with sinister men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They sought our trees—before rising to kill the white men aboard..."
