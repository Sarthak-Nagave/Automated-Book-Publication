**The Gates of Morning: Chapter 1 — The Canoe Builder**

Standing atop a coral ledge, Dick gazed towards the southern horizon. Behind him, the relentless roar of the outer sea reverberated, flinging salty spindrift into the air. In front of him lay an expanse as calm as a lake—Karolin's tranquil blue lagoon—graced by the swooping flights of fishing gulls.

Encircled by a vast 40-mile coral ring, this serene body of water was its own world—a tempestuous sea in stormy weather, and an azure sanctuary in gentler times. And now, it all belonged to him. Dick, who had arrived on these shores just the day before.

The beach buzzed with life under the blazing sun. Women, children, and youth engaged in their daily tasks: fishing with nets, playing games, and working hard on the paraka patches. They were his people now. The canoes resting on the sand, the deserted houses once housing war canoes, all were his domain.

As Dick turned his gaze from the lagoon towards the canoe houses, a shadow of thought crossed his face. Turning away from the gentle waters, he faced the northern sea, engaging with the thunderous breakers crashing onto the outer beach. Beyond the horizon, shrouded in invisibility lay Palm Tree—a dreamy yet devilish island.

Sitting nearby on the coral was young Tari, the net maker Le Taioi’s son. For Tari, life was a series of simple, known truths. Yet, with all the Karolin men swept away by war, he realized they were left defenseless, without leadership, amidst only women, boys, and children like himself.

The women whispered that this mysterious newcomer was their destined chief, sent by the gods. But Tari was unbothered by divine mysteries. Alone with this intriguing stranger and free from his mother's earshot, he asked directly, with all a child's candidness.

"Taori," little Tari ventured, "who are you?" 

If Dick dared to answer, could Tari comprehend the extraordinary tale he might unfold? "Tari," Dick could say, "I'm from a world beyond yours. My name is Dick Lestrange. As a child smaller than you, I was stranded with an old sailor, Kearney, on that distant island you call Marua—Palm Tree—lying unseen fifty miles to the north. Kearney taught me the ways of fishing and crafting toy ships unlike your canoes.

And then one day, Katafa arrived—the girl whisked away in a storm. Together we waited after Kearney’s passing, isolated but free. She revealed the language of Karolin to me, naming me Taori. Bonded by love, we might have lingered forever on Marua—until a ship surfaced on the horizon, swarming with sinister men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They sought our trees—before rising to kill the white men aboard..."
